# Contributing to A Harmonic Field Model of Consciousness in the Human Brain

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project.

This repository hosts the LaTeX source for **Bridge Paper I** in the VFD–Orch-OR unification programme: a candidate harmonic field model that integrates Penrose-Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction with Vibrational Field Dynamics (VFD). Our goal is to clarify, critique, and extend the theory in a rigorous and collaborative way.

## Scope of Contributions

This project represents a **candidate theory** subject to empirical investigation. It defines a research programme, not established fact. We welcome contributions that strengthen, extend, critique, or test this framework.

### In Scope

#### Textual and LaTeX Improvements
- Typo corrections
- Clarity improvements
- Structural reorganization
- Figure quality enhancements
- Accessibility improvements

#### Mathematical Refinements
- Derivation checks and error corrections
- Better notation or alternative formulations
- Dimensional analysis verification
- Limiting case analysis

#### Bibliographic Suggestions
- Missing references
- Better citations for existing claims
- Related theoretical frameworks we should acknowledge

#### Conceptual Critique
- Well-reasoned challenges to assumptions
- Identification of logical gaps in derivations
- Alternative interpretations of the formalism
- Skeptical analysis of quantum consciousness claims

### Out of Scope

The following are **not appropriate** for this repository:

- Implementation of AI agents, consciousness simulators, or cryptographic systems
- Speculative spiritual claims not grounded in physics or mathematics
- Marketing or promotional content
- Personal opinions presented as scientific critique

## Scientific Philosophy

We explicitly invite rigorous critique from researchers in:

- **Quantum foundations** — Assessments of the quantum mechanical formalism and interpretational claims
- **Neuroscience** — Evaluation of biological plausibility and empirical consistency
- **Complexity theory and computability** — Analysis of the Turing-limits framing and continuous dynamics claims
- **Philosophy of mind** — Critical engagement with the consciousness-related interpretations

Skepticism about quantum consciousness is welcome and expected; we only ask that critique be substantive and scientifically grounded.

### On Orch-OR and Penrose

This framework treats Penrose's gravitational objective reduction (OR) as a **necessary component** of the dual transition criterion. Penrose's gravitational OR remains the trigger; VFD refines the boundary conditions and scaling structure. Contributions should maintain this compatibility unless proposing a well-justified modification.

Disagreement with Orch-OR, Penrose, or VFD is welcome as long as arguments are specific and evidence-based.

### On Turing Limits and Continuous Dynamics

The framework proposes that continuous, φ-scaled field dynamics operate in a geometric domain broader than discrete Turing-style computation. This does **not** claim to "solve the halting problem" or violate standard computability theory. Rather, we highlight that continuous physical systems may implement behaviors not naturally captured by classical step-wise machine models, while discrete computation remains a valid limiting case.

3. Make your changes
4. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description

### For Scientific Contributions

1. **Open an Issue first** — Describe your proposed contribution using the appropriate issue template
2. Wait for discussion and approval
3. Fork and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/extended-prediction-8`
4. Make your changes with clear commit messages

### For Mathematical Corrections

If you believe you've found an error in our derivations:

1. Open an Issue titled: `[Math Review] Section X.Y - Description`
2. Clearly state:
   - The equation number(s) involved

   - Your proposed correction with derivation
3. We will review and respond

## Scientific Rigor Requirements

### For Mathematical Contributions

Contributions involving quantum gravity, microtubule physics, harmonic field dynamics, or VFD mathematics **must** include:

1. **Reproducibility steps** — Clear derivation pathway that others can follow step-by-step
2. **Symbolic derivations** — Full mathematical working, not just results
3. **Explicit assumptions** — All approximations and simplifications clearly stated
4. **Parameter bounds** — Physically motivated ranges with sources
5. **Consistency check** — Compatibility with existing framework equations
6. **Dimensional analysis** — Verify all equations are dimensionally consistent
7. **Limiting cases** — Show behavior in relevant limits (classical, single-particle, etc.)
8. **Computability implications** — If relevant, note whether a formalism changes what is classically computable vs. realized by continuous systems

### For Theoretical Extensions

1. **Be internally consistent** with existing formalism
2. **Preserve Penrose OR compatibility** — We extend Orch-OR, not replace it
3. **Generate testable predictions** where possible
4. **Maintain mathematical rigor** with clear derivations
5. **Acknowledge limitations** and assumptions
6. **Use cautious language** — "proposes," "suggests," "may," not "proves"

### For Experimental Suggestions

1. **Clear hypothesis** derived from the framework
2. **Methodology outline** (equipment, measurements, controls)
3. **Expected results** for confirmation vs. falsification
4. **Feasibility assessment** (current technology, cost)
5. **Technology status** — Whether methods currently exist

## Style Guidelines

### LaTeX Style

Use the notation conventions defined in the `main.tex` preamble. Key macros include:

| Macro | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `\gr` | Golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 |
| `\Cfield` | Coherence field C |
| `\Ccrit` | Critical coherence threshold C_c |
| `\Tfield` | Torsional field operator |
| `\Rfield` | Reduction/transition operator |
| `\EG` | Gravitational self-energy E_G |
| `\taucol` | Transition timescale τ |
| `\omegagr` | φ-scaled frequency ω_φ |

### Language Style

Use scientifically cautious language:
- ✓ "The framework proposes..."
- ✓ "This model suggests a mechanism by which..."
- ✓ "Further validation is required."

Avoid:
- ✗ "This proves consciousness originates..."
- ✗ "This is the final model..."
- ✗ "This confirms quantum consciousness is true..."
